I did not save the notes and takeways from the first three videos. I had them typed up or possibly wrote them elsewhere and i will find out. 



Video 4-Binding to Custom Properties
We started in the server element component.html file where we see that it is trying to access a variable named "element" but the element is not defined in our server-element ts file yet. 
sp we go to the ts file and create that.
in the TS file under export class ServerElementComponent we create it like  like as a JS object
element:{type:string,name:string,content:string}

then in the app.component.html where we add <app-server-element>which we are going to have loop through the serverElements like this:
<app-server-element
*ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements"
[element]="serverElement"
></app-server-element>
Where we are using the structural directive *ngFor to loop through the <app-server-element> where we are assigning a variable "serverElement" to be created for each item in the serverElemnts array and log it? 
and then we are property binding the element property object we created and having it equal or vice versa the new serverElement for each iteration?
