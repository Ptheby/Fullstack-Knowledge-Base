I did not save the notes and takeways from the first three videos. I had them typed up or possibly wrote them elsewhere and i will find out. 



Video 4-Binding to Custom Properties
We started in the server element component.html file where we see that it is trying to access a variable named "element" but the element is not defined in our server-element ts file yet. 
sp we go to the ts file and create that.
in the TS file under export class ServerElementComponent we create it like  like as a JS object
element:{type:string,name:string,content:string}

then in the app.component.html where we add <app-server-element>which we are going to have loop through the serverElements like this:
<app-server-element
*ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements"
[element]="serverElement"
></app-server-element>
Where we are using the structural directive *ngFor to loop through the <app-server-element> where we are assigning a variable "serverElement" to be created for each item in the serverElemnts array and log it? 
and then we are property binding the element property object we created and having it equal or vice versa the new serverElement for each iteration?


Video 5- Assigning an Alias to Custom Properties
in the prior vide we learned how to bind to our own customer properties, in this case "element" in our server-elemt ts file, that we end up using in the <app-server-element>
in the app.component.html file. Where we bind to it with square brackets BUT NOT BEFORE we add @INPUT () back at the server-element ts file BEFORE element. like this:
 @Input() element:{type:string, name:string,content:string};

this allows us to bind to our custom, made-up property element. 


now for video 5. Sometimes we want to name a property something else if we are outside of that compenent so that it might be more descriptive or let us know maybe where it came from.
Like in this case, "element" might not tell us where it came from so maybe in the app component html we want to definitely let everyone know this came from the server-element-component.
so we want to do this at the app.component.html:

 <app-server-element
*ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements"
[srvElement]="serverElement"

but as of right now Angular does not know what "srvElement" is. We can assign this alias by going BACK TO THE server-element.component.ts file and pass this "alias name" as an argument
in the @Input('srvElement')
after we do this, now outside the component (or maybe in as well) element alone will not work it has to be srvElement. 


Video 6- Binding to Custom Events

So much information that i cant quite comprehend what happened apart from using an @Output and an imported "EventEmitter".

Video 7- Assigning an Alias to Custom Events
 this works the same as property binding alias where in the @Output() before the property....we put the alias in the paranthesis and then that property will only be know as the alias outside the component.

Video 9- Understanding View Encpapsulation
What i took away from this is that CSS only works in the relative components they are in. I watched this video a few times. Each element has it's own shadow dom as you can see while
inspect as the elements we are trying to style are given other attributes assigned by ANgular. Why it does this instead of just letting it work on whatever element we want like a
<p>, i am not sure. I will google it:
"Angular assigns a shadow DOM element instead of just an element because it allows you to encapsulate your component's code and styles, making it easier to maintain and test. The shadow DOM is also isolated from the rest of the page, which can help to prevent conflicts and security vulnerabilities."

Video 10- More on encapsulation

Here we learn that the natural encapsulation by Angular can be overwritten by including "encapsulation" under @Components where 
encapulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated is the default so no need to add but you can also use
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.none so that any style listed in this css file will now be applied globally.
