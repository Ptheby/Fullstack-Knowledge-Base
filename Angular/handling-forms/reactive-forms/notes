Video 1- Intro
Video 2- Reactive Setup
In this video we start in the TS file because Reactuve Forms apporach is creating the form programmatically. We start by creating a variable to hold our form and in this case we name it
signupForm= FormGroup   where FormGroup is an angular object thaat represents a group of related form controls. and we must IMPORT the FormGroup at the TS file at @angular/forms
and also at the app.module. ReactiveFormsModule in @NgMOdel


Video 3 Creating a form in Code

First we create a variable in the TS file named signupForm that will be assigned a value of = FormGroup which is an Angular object for forms, that we must import.
then we implement onInit, and in the ngOnInit we create a new instance of this formgroup to start are form and do that below. and create our first form controls with username,email, gender
by using the new FormControl keyword which must also be imported and we then set their initial values in paranthesis:


export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  genders = ["male", "female"];
  signupForm: FormGroup;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.signupForm = new FormGroup({
      'username': new FormControl("Default Username"), // this is creating controls and their default values which can also be null in my new formgroup
      'email': new FormControl(null),
      'gender': new FormControl('male')
    }); // this is our first basic form created programmatically.!
