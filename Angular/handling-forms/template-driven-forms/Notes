Starting these notes @ video 5 of the Angular Forms Video Series:
Video 5- TD: Creating the Form and Registering Controls

We create the form in the html of the component we are designing. Angular knows and gives certain characteristics only available to forms by IMPORTING the forms module at the app.module.ts
We register the controls by going to the inputs we want as controls and adding the directive ngModel. We also add right after this a name="username" or whatever name we are using for that input. 
We also do that with the <select> element because it is also a type of input and one we want to register

Video 6: TD: Submitting and Using the Form

- in the prior lecture we configured our form and added controls to certain inputs my placing ngMOdel on them and then naming them. In this video we make this submitttable so we can actually
see what the user entered. 
First we go to the app.component.ts file and add a new method we name onSubmit(). Instead of placing this method on a (click) event listener like i would assume, we take advantage of
Javascript/HTML's submit button and Angular does as well by placing a directive (ngSubmit)=onSubmit() in the form element. 
To test if this works we add a console log to the onSubmit method in the ts ('Submitted!") and it does log when we press the submit button.

Now to get access to the data that is entered in the form we go back to the template and we add a local reference with a custome name in this case #f, and then pass f into the onSubmit(f) method 
at the form element. and we then do this to the actual method in the ts file :
onSubmit(form:ElementRef) {
console.log(form)

When we submit this, it does show a form object and some weird stuff in the console but we want the actual values. 

To get the actual values we have to set the local referemce to ngForm like this  #f="nfForm" which tells Angular to give us access to the form automatically. so now we 
go remove the ElementRef in the actual method at ts and add ngForm. like this: 
}
  onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
    console.log(form)
  }
}
and the HTML looks like this: 

  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm">

Now when we submit data, we can scroll down to values and see the "name" we created after the ngMOdel of each input paired with the value entered and submitted by the user!

Video 7- TD Understanding Form State
 We did not code in this video but he shows alot of the properties of the JS object that is created by the form that we created through Angular. He touched on the dirty proeprty which
would show true if an input was changed, touched would show true if one was clicked on and it shows many others all related to the form. 

Video 8 TD: Accessing the Form with @ViewChild

Here we access the form with @ViewChild instead of passing the #f through the onSubmit() at the form element. So we take out the f parameter there at the onSubmit(f),
 and then on the ts file we comment out that onSubmit(form:Ngform) and instead at the @Viewchild decorate right at the start of the export class Appcomponent, which also imports it above
and then we pass 'f' as an argument and then name a variable signupForm: NgForm: which also is imported...then below we created another onSubmit with no argument and simply 
console log this.signupForm. Submitting this yields the form in the cosole. it looks like this: 

TS:
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild('f') signupForm: NgForm;
  suggestUserName() {
    const suggestedName = 'Superuser';
  }
  // }
  // onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
  //   console.log(form)
  // }
  onSubmit() {
    console.log(this.signupForm)

HTML: 
 <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" #f="ngForm">

Video 9- Adding Validation to check user input
In this video to add simple validation to our template driven approach, we add in the template on each input we are wanting to simply validate, we add the required keyword, and then we also add "email" also on the
email input form. these add directives to those input and gives it functionality for validation. In this case when we inspect the app if we have info in those fields and a word@email.com on the email, it will show true on the valid property 
of my form object in inspect or else it will show false. WE can also see on inpsect that depending on what we have entered, angular is adding ng-classes to our form(CSS)

Built-In Validators & Using HTML5 Validation-webiste https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators 
 
Video 10- Using the Form State

here we add some styling so that if a input box is touched and nothing valid is entered, a red border will surround the input showing that there needs to be action there. We do this with the input then ng-invalid and ng-touched
classes in the css file all together like this.
CSS
}
input.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
border: 1px solid red;
}

Video 11- Outputting Validation Error Message

HTML
right below the input for the email we enter this:
<span class="help-block" *ngIf="!email.valid && email.touched">Please enter a valid email!</span>

this is adding a statement conditional on the email being invalid and not touched. If those two conditions are met it dispales the message. In this case it only worked for me when i had !email.valid. Adding the email.touched did not work. 
we also had to add the a local reference #email to the input element of ngModel to then use that email. above. #email='ngMOdel'


Video 12- Set DEfault Values with ngModel Property Binding
  
HTML
 <select
          id="secret"
          class="form-control"
          [ngModel]="defaultQuestion"
          name="secret">
            <option value="pet">Your first Pet?</option>
            <option value="teacher">Your first teacher?</option>
          </select>
TS
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild('f') signupForm: NgForm;
  defaultQuestion='pet'

Here on the select the secret question element/input we are property binding to the ngMOdel and setting it to the new "defaultQuestion" variable we created in the TS. In the ts we create this vriable name and set it to "pet" which
is the option value that says "Your first pet?"    thus that will automatically get displayed by deafult until the user chooses something else.

Video 13
Using ngModel with two way binding

HTML
<div class="form-group">
          <textarea
          name="questionAnswer"
          class="form-control"
          rows="3"
          [(ngModel)]="answer"
          ></textarea>
        </div>
        <p>Your reply : {{answer}}</p>
TS
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild('f') signupForm: NgForm;
  defaultQuestion='pet';
  answer="";

Here we demostrate two-way databinding by creating a new textarea inside a new div that we can enter an answer to the secret question
where we also use 2 way bound [(ngModel)]to bind it to a new variable we create in the TS as answer equals an empty string.
Whatever is entered into this new text area, will be assigned to "answer" then we use string interpolation to display it right blow the text
area in a new <p>


Video 14- Grouping Form Controls

HTML
<div
        id="user-data"
        ngModelGroup="userData"
        #userData="ngModelGroup">
          <div class="form-group">
            <label for="username">Username</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              id="username"
              class="form-control"
              ngModel
              name="username"
              required
            />
          </div>
          <button class="btn btn-default" type="button">
            Suggest an Username
          </button>
          <div class="form-group">
            <label for="email">Mail</label>
            <input
              type="email"
              id="email"
              class="form-control"
              ngModel
              name="email"
              required
              email
              #email
            />
          </div>
         <span class="help-block" *ngIf="!email.valid && email.touched">Please enter a valid email!</span>
        </div>
        <p *ngIf="!userData.valid && userData.touched">User Data is Invalid!</p>


Here we are grouping the username and email elements which are located within the same DIV shown and that DIV that contains
both is where we add the directive ngModelGroup and set it to "userData" and then below that create the userData local reference aas
#userData="ngModelGroup" and below those two i put a new <p *ngIf="!userData.valid && userData.touched"> User data is not valid!</p>
so that if those two are not valid or either od them, after i touch them and before i submit because i cannot submit an empty form the 
way i have the button set up, it will display my message. 

Video 15- Handling Radio Buttons

First we assign a new variable named genders to an array of strings in the TS:
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild('f') signupForm: NgForm;
  defaultQuestion='pet';
  answer="";
  genders=['male','female','Rather Not Say'];


Then we go to the HTML and create a new div w class radio and the *ngFor directive to assign a value to the variable gender out of each
of the three gender answers i listed in the TS. Then we create a label with input inside with type radio, name "gender" ngModel to 
set this as a control and have the [value]="gender" and make it required. then i use string interpolation so that the values are then show besides the 
radio buttons. Now when i enter stuff and submit i can see gender listed and what was selected. 

<div class="radio" *ngFor="let gender of genders">
 <label>
 <input
 type="radio"
 name="gender"
 ngModel
 [value]="gender"
 required>
{{gender}}
</label>
</div>


Video 16- Setting and Patching Form Values

First in the HTML we assign a click listener to the buttong for the suggest username. and we run a new method we define in the ts called
suggestUserName(). In that method we actually do two things, First we use set value to allow us to override all the inputs on the form
to start with like this:  Where this.signupForm is taken from the @ViewChild and we use .setValue to then go through and set our values for each 
property like userData and the username and email within it. Then onto secret, questionAnswer, gender. This can set them all if we want. 
if we only want to do one or a certain amount we can use patchValue like i will show below this. 


.setValue approach
suggestUserName() {
    const suggestedName = 'Superuser';
    // this.signupForm.setValue({
    //   userData: {
    //     username: suggestedName,
    //     email: ''
    //   },
    //   secret: 'pet',
    //   questionAnswer:'',
    //   gender: 'male'
    // });

patch.value approach to just change less than all values!

this.signupForm.form.patchValue({
      userData: {
        username: suggestedName
      }
    });

Video 17 Using Form Data

In this lecture we show how we can display or use the data given to us in the form by displaying it below the form. First, in the TS
we create a new variable called user that is an object with empty string values for these keys:

user= {
    username:'',
    email:'',
    secretQuestion:'',
    answer:'',
    gender:''
  };

then we change the onSubmit method to assign each of those new variable items values from the corresponding form inputs like this.

onSubmit() {
    this.submitted= true;
    this.user.username=this.signupForm.value.userData.username;
    this.user.email=this.signupForm.value.userData.email;
    this.user.secretQuestion=this.signupForm.value.secret;
    this.user.answer=this.signupForm.value.questionAnswer;
    this.user.gender=this.signupForm.value.gender;
  }

Then over in the HTML we are going to display that data only nfIF submitted is true. which it is when we press submit via the 
onSubmit method above. 

 <hr>
<div class="row" *ngIf="submitted">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <h3>Your Data</h3>
    <p>Username:{{user.username}}</p>
    <p>Mail:{{user.email}}</p>
    <p>Secret Question:{{user.secretQuestion}}</p>
    <p>Answer:{{user.answer}}</p>
    <p>Gender:{{user.gender}}</p>


Video 18- REsettting Forms

to reset this particular form or template driven forms we are just going to add the .reset control directive to the end of the onSubmit method in ts

onSubmit() {
    this.submitted= true;
    this.user.username=this.signupForm.value.userData.username;
    this.user.email=this.signupForm.value.userData.email;
    this.user.secretQuestion=this.signupForm.value.secret;
    this.user.answer=this.signupForm.value.questionAnswer;
    this.user.gender=this.signupForm.value.gender;

    this.signupForm.reset();
  }
